# WhatsApp Heatmap
#### Analysis and describes the level of WhatsApp group activity as function of the weekdays (in the x axis) and the hour (in the y axis).

## Description
This project allows you to see and analyse your WhatsApp group chat in a prettier and concise way.
I programmed with Python and used libraries as: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Working with Python and these useful libraries combination with Git, has contributed to my knowledge and abilities.
In addition, this project made me intrested in Data Science and as a result of that i'll continue to learn and dive deeper into this subject. 

## How to use?
* Export your WhatsApp group chat and **rename** it to `WhatsApp.txt` file.
* Put the WhatsApp text file in the project folder.
* Open `main.py` file and see the results.
